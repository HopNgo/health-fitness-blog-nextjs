## GET SOCIAL

> “Try forming an exercise group with friends and set up meetings 2–3 times a week. Use free resources like a local park, high school track, community pool or someone’s home. Keep it fun and engaging for all by partnering the event with something like going out for coffee afterwards.”

## INVEST IN A DECK OF CARDS

> “It’s amazing how many workout routines you can build into a simple deck of cards. Aces are one, face cards are 13 and everything else is its corresponding number. Flip a card and perform pushups corresponding to each card’s value. Take a short breather and then flip another card, repeating through as many cards as you can.”

## FIND PASSES

> “Look for seven-day class passes and trial memberships. To avoid being charged, set a reminder on your phone to cancel if you’re not committed.”

## USE YOUR OWN BODY

> “Free workout options include walking, pushups, planks and walking up and down the steps of your house.”

> Joe Cannon, MS, certified strength and conditioning specialist, NSCA certified personal trainer

## SEEK OUT DISCOUNT SITES

> “Many gyms, especially newer ones, offer great deals on discount sites like Groupon in an effort to bring in potential members. You can save up to 80% on a monthly membership if you’re willing to be flexible in what type of gym you attend. One month you could box, another you could do Pilates, a third you could do an outdoor boot camp.”

## GET RESISTANCE BANDS

> “You can get a premium set of resistance bands with all of the attachments you’ll ever need for under $100. If you travel for business or pleasure, many of these resistance band sets come with a travel bag so you can toss it in your suitcase or vehicle and take it with you.”

## LOOK INTO CORPORATE WELLNESS

> “Some companies subsidize workouts and some specialized trainers and gyms accept health insurance or have arrangements with programs such as Silver Sneakers.”

## INVEST IN KETTLEBELLS

> “Kettlebells are small but effective. For someone at home, you don’t need a large collection of bells. One bell is enough for most people. It adds some weight resistance with movements at an affordable cost. They also don’t take up much room; you can put it in the car to travel to a park or other location for a workout.”
