There are those people who come to work in the morning looking like they stepped out of a salon and casually mentioned how they read the paper over a long and leisurely breakfast. Then there are those who would gladly sport a ponytail everyday and skip breakfast completely if it means they can get an extra seven minutes of sleep.

Since it’s important to eat breakfast once hunger strikes, we’d like to show you there’s more to a quick breakfast than what’s inside the cereal box:

## OVERNIGHT OATS

> If you haven’t already, it’s time to revisit this new classic. Mix oatmeal with plain yogurt and a drizzle of honey, then refrigerate overnight in a Mason jar or container. It’s an ideal on-the-go option because it’s pre-packaged, not messy and good for you.

## MICROWAVE EGGS

> Crack two eggs into a small mason jar with a splash of milk and a sprinkle of salt and drop it in your bag. When you get to work, remove the lid and pop it into the office microwave for 30-second intervals until the whites are firm but the yolks are little runny. Stir together to create warm, creamy scrambled eggs.

## COTTAGE CHEESE

> Yogurt is the go-to dairy staple for mornings, but like cereal, plain yogurt gets dull and the fruit-on-the-bottom kind is full of added sugars. Instead, cottage cheese is packed with protein and no added sweeteners and is the perfect foundation for banana slices, berries and a little granola.

## LAST NIGHT’S LEFTOVERS

> I’m a big fan of having dinner for breakfast. Lean chicken or pork is fantastic served with half an avocado the next day. Bean soups or rich stews often only need a fried egg put on the top to make it morning worthy. But my all-time favorite, easy breakfast is leftover Indian or Chinese food. If you haven’t slurped up day-old channa masala or chow mein at your desk with a cup of coffee, you don’t know what you’re missin
