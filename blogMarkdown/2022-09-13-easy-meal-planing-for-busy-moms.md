Planning, preparing, and cooking healthy meals takes time, ðŸ¤” and meal planning in advance can help us make healthy meals for the family on a more consistent basis.ðŸ˜‰

## Setting aside time to make a weekly meal plan

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set aside 30 minutes or so each weekend to create your plan for the week. For us, dinners are the most important, but I also have an idea of what Iâ€™m going to pack in the girlsâ€™ lunches and make for breakfasts. Plan out as many meals as youâ€™d like for the week, emphasizing dinner and weekly staples.

## Create a master list

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After youâ€™ve planned out your meals, make a master grocery list including all of the ingredients. Take inventory of your pantry and fridge to avoid buying duplicates, unless you like having backups on hand.

## sking help from family members

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to ask the kids if thereâ€™s anything theyâ€™d like to have the following week and use their suggestions when I craft my list. Iâ€™ll also put a few cookbooks on the table for them to choose recipes that look good to them. Sometimes they surprise me with their selections and I love that helps to shake things up and prevent dinner ruts.

## Free Weekly Meal Plan For Busy Moms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a free weekly template I created for meal planning. If you need more help, enter your email address here and Iâ€™ll send you a free copy of meal prep blueprint! It has my exact strategy for meal planning, along with some new recipes.

```
    - Sunday: Steak, roasted asparagus, salad kit, homemade sourdough

    - Monday: Chili with gluten-free cornbread and salad

    - Tuesday: Taco Tuesday (out!)

    - Wednesday: Garlic-lime chicken thighs with sweet potatoes and zucchini

    - Thursday: Greek bowls (rice, chicken, grape leaves, hummus, tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, and olives)

    - Friday: Takeout

    - Saturday: Hodge podge (mix of leftovers and/or breakfast for dinner)

So, tell me, friends: do you plan your meals in advance? Whatâ€™s on the menu this week?

## Prep protein or anything you can in advance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to wash fresh fruit and veggies, chop anything I can for dinners and easy snacking, and prep a couple of protein staples. Iâ€™ll usually boil eggs and smoke chicken for the week. Anything you can do you set yourself up for advance: do it. I also like to mention that if youâ€™re able to splurge on more convenience items that will make your life easier (like chicken that is already cooked and cut into pieces), do what you need to do to set yourself up for success.

## Use a meal planning template

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This helps a ton if youâ€™re going to plan out meals for the week! Simply print, add in your meals, and write out your grocery list on the opposite side.
