MyFitnessPal Premium lets you take your health and fitness to the next level with features that power your food and exercise tracking ability. If you have Premium, we want to make sure you get the most out of it. Beyond an ad-free app experience and access to priority customer support, these 13 features make the logging experience much easier and more rewarding.

## CUSTOMIZE YOUR DAILY MACRONUTRIENT GOALSs

> MyFitnessPal automatically generates your macronutrient goals (e.g., carbohydrates, protein, fats) based on expert recommended macronutrient percentages: 20% of calories from protein, 50% of calories from carbohydrates and 30% of calories from fat. But, if you follow a special eating plan focused on particular macronutrients (Think: low-carb, high-protein, IIFYM), Premium gives you the flexibility to adjust your macronutrient goals by percentages and grams.

## CUSTOMIZE YOUR DAILY CALORIE GOAL

> MyFitnessPal automatically generates a calorie goal suited to the rate of weight loss or gain you desire. For the most part, this calorie goal stays constant on a day-to-day basis. With Premium, you can set different calorie goals for different days of the week. This is helpful if you need to plan for a cheat day, if you practice intermittent fasting or calorie cycling to reach your weight goals.

## QUICK-ADD MACRONUTRIENTS YOU CARE ABOUT

> As a Premium user, you can use the quick-add feature for carbohydrates, protein and fats the same way you quick-add calories into your food diary. This is a convenient tool if you care more about macronutrients than your overall calorie goal.

## SCAN YOUR MEALS

> Log your food even faster with the new Meal Scan feature, which allows you to take a photo of your food to locate it in the database â€” no typing required.


## USE FOOD ANALYSIS TO LEARN FROM YOUR FOOD CHOICES

> Tracking isnâ€™t just about counting calories â€” itâ€™s a way for you to learn about what youâ€™re choosing to eat. You gain insight like how three slices of cheese pizza is way more calories than you need at one meal. As a Premium user, you can customize the app to show you which foods are highest in the nutrient you care about. You can see which food choices help cut your sodium in half or meet a quarter of your protein goal for the day with just one glance.

## CHOOSE WHERE YOUR EXERCISE CALORIES GO

> When users complete an exercise, the calories you burn are automatically added back into your calorie goal for the day. Premium users, however, can choose whether or not to add exercise calories back into their daily calorie goal. You can even customize whether you want the calories added back as carbohydrates, fat or protein. This feature is particularly helpful if youâ€™re carb conscious and only want to eat a certain number of carbohydrate grams per day. You can tell the app to add exercise calories back as just fat and protein.


## CUSTOMIZE YOUR NUTRIENT DASHBOARD

> Your nutrient dashboard quickly shows you which nutrients youâ€™re missing for the day, and your progress in meeting your calorie and nutrient goals. MyFitnessPal automatically sets your dashboard to display food calories, exercise calories and calories remaining. As a Premium user, you can customize your dashboard and put the nutrients you care about front and center.

## EXPORT YOUR INFORMATION

> With Premium, you can export your information into a set of CSV files you can open in Excel or another software program. You can play around with your information and do a deep dive into your habits by creating custom graphs. You can also print your files and share them with your personal trainer, nutritionist, registered dietitian, friends or family members.

## SET YOUR CALORIE GOALS BY MEAL

> Premium lets you break down your daily nutrient goals into smaller, meal-sized calorie goals to help keep you on track throughout the day. For example, if your goal is to hit 1,200 calories for the day, you can allocate 300 calories for breakfast, 300 calories for lunch, 400 calories for dinner and 200 calories for snacks. You can plan a large dinner calorie goal to enjoy an evening out with friends or choose to make breakfast king, so you have a solid start to your day. Divide your calories in a way that makes the most sense for your unique lifestyle and eating habits.
