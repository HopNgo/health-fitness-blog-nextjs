Grilling peaches makes them extra juicy and sweet, providing a perfect counterpoint to grilled chicken and earthy French lentils in this warm, main course salad. Dark green French lentils hold their shape while cooking, which makes them ideal for salads. Find them in the bulk section of the supermarket.

## Grilled Chicken, Lentil and Peach Salad

#### Ingredients

> - 1/2 cup (170g) French green lentils (lentils du puy)
> - 3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
> - 2 1/2 tablespoons (37mL) olive oil
> - 2 tablespoons (20g) shallots, finely chopped
> - 1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
> - 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
> - 1 tablespoon honey
> - 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
> - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
> - 4 small (6 ounce/170g) boneless skinless chicken breasts
> - 2 large (6 ounce/170 g) stone peaches, halved and pitted
> - 1/2 cup (12g) loosely packed mint leaves, torn
> - 1/2 cup (12g) loosely packed basil leaves, torn

#### Directions

> In a small saucepan, combine the lentils with 3 cups (710mL) water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the lentils are just tender, about 25 minutes. Drain.

> While the lentils are cooking, preheat a grill over medium heat. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, oil, shallots, vinegar, mustard, honey, garlic and pepper. Place 2 tablespoons of the mixture in a medium bowl, add the chicken and toss to coat, set the remaining dressing aside.

> Place the chicken and peach halves, cut side down, on the grill. Cook until the chicken is cooked through (an instant-read thermometer will register 165°F/74°C when inserted into the thickest part), about 5 minutes per side. Cook the peaches until charred on the cut side and softened slightly, 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes. Cut chicken into thin slices and the peaches into bite-size pieces.

> Divide the warm lentils among 4 plates. Arrange the chicken and peaches over the top. Sprinkle with the herbs and drizzle each salad with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the remaining dressing. Serve warm.

> Serves: 4 |  Serving Size: 1/4 of the lentils, 1 chicken breast, 1/2 peach, 1/4 cup herbs, 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing
