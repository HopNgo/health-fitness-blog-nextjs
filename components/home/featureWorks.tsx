        "Connection and socialization are key components to mental health and happiness. You might wonder, how can socializing help you live a healthier lifestyle? Well, making friends with people that are interested in their health can be pivotal in your ability to live a healthy lifestyle. When a person shares their goals with someone else, they are 65% more likely to achieve the goal. It is quite common that we do things with our friends or even mimic them. This is a natural part of friendship, and this is the key reason connecting with other people can help you live a healthy lifestyle. If you have a friend or friends that are healthy minded, you are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle. You might even be the healthy friend inspiring others.",
